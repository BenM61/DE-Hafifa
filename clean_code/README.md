# Python Clean Code Exercise
Now when you know how to write a basic code in python and know the syntax, we'll see how to write a good code:)

You have a file of a mp3 player that works, but is badly written.

Your mission is to take the code and organize it as much as you can.
To help you, you have a git repo that sums up the principles of Python Clean Code.

Good luck!
