# Stock Price Mining Exercise - Multithreading

This exercise is based on a real case where the information was used for research on predicting stock prices using Twitter. For more details, feel free to reach out to Tomer.

## Part 1

The stock we want to track for hourly changes from the provided list of hours is Bitcoin. You are required to use multithreading to write a CSV file containing the following columns: hour, stock type, and the percentage change (increase/decrease) of the stock.

### Recommendations:
- Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for multithreaded operations.
- Use the `yahooFinance` library to fetch stock price data.
- Use `pandas` to write the results to a CSV file.

The name of the CSV file should be retrieved from an environment variable called `DESTINATION_FILE`, and the path to the file containing the hours should be read from another environment variable.

## Part 2

In the first part, we focused only on Bitcoin. Now, adapt your existing code to handle multiple stock types. In addition to Bitcoin, include the stocks for Google and Amazon, and save all the data into the same CSV file created in Part 1.

### Environment Variables:
- **Amazon**: `AMAZON_DATES` (file: `amazon_dates.txt`)
- **Google**: `GOOGLE_DATES` (file: `google_dates.txt`)
- **Bitcoin**: `BITCOIN_DATES` (file: `bitcoin_dates.txt`)

### Additional Requirements:
- Modify the code so it can process multiple stock types concurrently using the multithreaded approach.
- Ensure the final CSV file contains records for all three stocks, with the following columns:
   - **Hour**
   - **Stock Type**
   - **Percentage Change**

### Recommendations:
- Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for handling threading efficiently.
- Use `pandas` to append data from each stock type into the same CSV file.
- Ensure proper error handling for data retrieval and CSV writing.

## Good Luck, Champions! (:
